This repository contains the latex source for the "Persistence Mechanics of the Quantum Vacuum III" paper which defines the three rules by which systems partion themselves.

and then validates this by applying this to E8 to derive the constants such as

## Reproducibility

A core tenet of this work is that the physical constants are computational outputs. To verify the results found in the papers:

### 2. Generate the Constants
To regenerate the values for $\alpha^{-1}$, $\alpha_s$, $G_F$, etc., run:
```bash
python calculations/constants.py
```
To re-generate the latex output that is used in the paper
```bash
python calculations/constants.py --latex
```

## Simulations

This order follows the logical reconstruction of the universe: **(1) The Constants** $\to$ **(2) The Static Laws** $\to$ **(3) The Dynamic Laws**.

### Logical Execution Order

**1. `calculations/e8_impedance_calculator.py`** (The Constants)
> Performs a Monte Carlo diffusion audit on the projected $E_8$ lattice to derive the **Fine-Structure Constant** ($\alpha^{-1} \approx 137.036$) and **Manifold Friction** ($\eta \approx 0.994$). This confirms that fundamental couplings are not arbitrary inputs, but the geometric impedance of the substrate to information propagation.

**2. `calculations/capacity_conservation_gravity.py`** (The Static Limit)
> Simulates the relaxation of a static mass defect on a $96^4$ lattice to minimize Entropic Action. It numerically recovers the **Inverse-Square Law** ($\Phi \propto r^{-2}$) and verifies 4D Gauss's Law to within 6%, proving that the Newtonian potential emerges naturally from the conservation of channel capacity.

**3. `calculations/e8_gravity_killswitch.py`** (The Dynamic Limit)
> Injects transverse-traceless metric perturbations into the lattice to verify the emergence of the **Einstein-Hilbert Action**. It confirms that the gravitational carrier is a strictly massless ($m=0$), spin-2 Goldstone mode propagating at the speed of light ($c=1$), validating General Relativity as the hydrodynamic limit of the substrate.
